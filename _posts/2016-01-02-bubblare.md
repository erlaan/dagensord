Bubbla = Bubble

**Bubblare** is a slang word.

### What does it mean?

**Bubblare** is something that just didn't make the "list". Almost, superclose but not on it.  
A **Bubblare** will eventually make it's way on the list.

eg: A top 10 list of fav actors can have a few **bubblare**.  
Worth mentioning but not actually on the list.

The equivalent in english could maybe be **"Honorable mention"**
