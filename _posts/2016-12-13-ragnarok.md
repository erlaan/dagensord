### What does it mean?

**Ragnarök** is a Swedish word name for Ragnarok, the apocalypse in norse mythology.

"In Norse mythology, Ragnarök is a series of future events, including a great battle, foretold to ultimately 
result in the death of a number of major figures (including the gods Odin, Thor, Týr, Freyr, Heimdallr, and 
Loki), the occurrence of various natural disasters, and the subsequent submersion of the world in water. 
Afterward, the world will resurface anew and fertile, the surviving and returning gods will meet, and the 
world will be repopulated by two human survivors. Ragnarök is an important event in the Norse mythology, and 
has been the subject of scholarly discourse and theory throughout the history of Germanic studies." -
